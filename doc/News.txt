Looking better for a good whitelist functionality.  Found and tested
a bit of the HTTP::Proxy module for a forced server.  And found out
iptables module ipt_owner which allows rules to match based on the
owner of the socket connecting.  This should be enough to block the
user without interfering with system functions (DHCP/NTP).  So we
can DNAT to a local proxy server running as root.
