Woot! bugs.  (at least people are trying it.)

* iptables v1.3.8 (and others maybe) don't support '-S' option to
  show chains.  v1.4.4 does.  No big deal, still works just gave a
  couple error messages.  Those errors are now hidden.

* Rather annoying, default Ubuntu doesn't have a save/restore iptables
  on shutdown/reboot.  I just assumed it did (CentOS does :P)  Fixed
  but takes a bit of manual work from the Terminal.

  wget http://svn.jklmnop.net/proj/SelfControl/trunk/contrib/selfcontrol.sh
  sudo cp selfcontrol.sh /etc/init.d/selfcontrol
  sudo mkdir /etc/selfcontrol
  sudo update-rc.d selfcontrol defaults
  sudo /etc/init.d/selfcontrol stop
  # no need to 'start' again.

That's it, ripped it off from from the iptables-persistent package, but
that version didn't save before shutdown, just restored from a file on
reboot.  (it's just an iptables-save and iptables-restore wraped up in an
init script.)

Now with sortable listing of active blocks.  Needs some sudoers hacking.
Sortable lists. Refactored down to a 63 line driver script with seperate
modes for root vs. user stuff.  Hope to add in a HTTP proxy mode as well.
Next on the list is more clean/docs/test and adding in Whitelists with
proxy redirection, saved favorite configurations, etc.

Factoring continues into Root, Config, SelfControl
Add syslogging
Add menus
Add about
Add viewing active blocks (almost)

Factored GUI stuff into SelfControl::UI.
Got build to install icons and desktop file. Still will need to run
'desktop-file-install /usr/share/applications/selfcontrol.desktop' manually
to get it added to the Applications->Internet menu.
You can no longer just copy the main script to upgrade, modules do things
now.

Updated config file version (automatic upgrade of old versions).
Changed config file location detection to avoid having to use
preserve environment on sudo (security sanity).
Block time now in hours/minutes (5 minute interval), slider gives
pretty value display.

----------------------------

Added a rough /etc/hosts file hijack.  Hosts given as a name (example.com)
instead of just an IP are added to the hosts file at 127.0.0.2.  That
address is chosen to not interfere with any real servers running on the
usual 127.0.0.1 (localhost) address.  Future plans will probably match
on the address via iptables rules to redirect to a localhost:8888 or
something web proxy for whitelist and/or just nagging the user who
tries anyway.

This should help a bit with hosts that change DNS info often either
round-robin or dynamic.  iptables can't do this as it's in the
application layer vs the network layer.

Thanks to Eric Kow for the request.

Looking better for a good whitelist functionality.  Found and tested
a bit of the HTTP::Proxy module for a forced server.  And found out
iptables module ipt_owner which allows rules to match based on the
owner of the socket connecting.  This should be enough to block the
user without interfering with system functions (DHCP/NTP).  So we
can DNAT to a local proxy server running as root.
