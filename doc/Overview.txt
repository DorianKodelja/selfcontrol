Overview
--------

Task: Block access internet sites for a given period of time.

Blocking is done via iptables, a custom chain is added to the the
default OUTPUT chain, blocks are added to the custom chain.

iptables -N SelfControl
iptables -A OUTPUT -j SelfControl

iptables -A SelfControl -d example.com -j DROP
...

Unblocking is done by removing entries from the custom chain.

iptables -D SelfControl -d example.com -j DROP
...

Scheduling the unblocks is done via the 'at' command.

cat << _EOF_ | at now + 1 min
iptables -D SelfControl -d example.com -j DROP
...
_EOF_

That's it.  Simple.  There is a function that checks for the existance
of the custom chain setup and creates it if needed.  And another function
that takes a list of IP addresses and a timeout value, adds the blocks
and schedules the job to remove the blocks in the future.

The program does a check when starting, if run as an ordinary user, it
presents the GUI for managing the list of IPs and the timeout.  If the
'Start' button is clicked, the configuration is saved and the program
re-runs itself with root priviledges.

When run with root priviledges, the program reads the configuration,
applies the blocks and schedules the unblocks.

if root, load config, check chain, apply blocks, schedule unblocks.
if user, load config, run GUI, 'Cancel' or 'Start', if 'Start', save
config, run as root, if 'Cancel' do nothing and exit.
